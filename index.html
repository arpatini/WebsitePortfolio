        <img src="circleHeadShot.png" alt="Where did the picture of my face go?">
        <p>I am currently a graduate student in the
          Master of Computer and Information Technology (MCIT) Program at the University of Pennsylvania.
          I started the program in the Spring of 2019 and am expecting to graduate in the Fall of 2020.
        </p>
        <p>I did my undergraduate degree in math at UPenn, but switched into
          computer science because I want to be a software engineer. I would like to combine
          my love of music and computer science into a career as a software engineer for a music
          based company.

        <h2>Music/Hobbies (But Mostly Music)</h2>

        <p> I have loved music for as long as I can remember. I have been singing, songwriting, and playing guitar
          and piano for years, and have recently begun recording my music. I have released an EP and a single and
          I also have an album coming out soon. I plan on mixing my passion for music with my love of computer
          science by becoming a software engineer for a music company. Being a musician, and an avid music listener,
          with a slight broadway obsession, I am able to bring needed aspects of creativity into a field that is just
          as much creative as it is technical.
